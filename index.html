                          To minimise the energy consumption of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile technology, it is necessary to adapt the transmission capabilities of 5G networks to the end-users' quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this line, researchers are investigating novel machine learning (ML) algorithms, which fed by network measurement data and empowered by the computing capabilities of dedicated hardware, can help modelling and predicting user behaviour. In this paper, we focus on the task of forecasting mobile traffic, which is a key step to dynamically adapt network parameters to space-time traffic variations by optimizing energy efficiency features, such as carrier shutdown. Specifically, we present a state-of-the-art ML framework based on Graph convolutional Networks, and compare its performance with simpler schemes, characterized by a lower complexity. Our analysis highlights advantages and drawbacks of these solutions, paying special attention to the importance of the error metric selection, feature pre-processing and historical data availability.

                          Cellular networks have changed the world we are living in, and the fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is expected to further revolutionise our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low latency communications. In addition, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) specification also provides tools to significantly decrease the energy consumption and the green house emissions of next generations networks, thus contributing towards information and communication technology (ICT) sustainability targets. In this survey paper, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art on current energy efficiency research. We first categorise and carefully analyse the different power consumption models and energy efficiency metrics, which have helped to make progress on the understanding of green networks. Then, as a main contribution, we survey in detail -- from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint -- the main energy efficiency enabling features that 3GPP NR provides, together with their main benefits and challenges. Special attention is paid to four key technology features, i.e., massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), lean carrier design, and advanced idle modes, together with the role of artificial intelligence capabilities. We dive into their implementation and operational details, and thoroughly discuss their optimal operation points and theoretical-trade-offs from an energy consumption perspective. This will help the reader to grasp the fundamentals of -- and the status on -- green networking. Finally, the areas of research where more effort is needed to make future networks greener are also discussed.                  </div></div><p>

                The deployment of dense networks of small base stations represents one of the most promising solutions for future mobile networks to meet the foreseen increasing trafﬁc demands. However, such an infrastructure consumes a considerable amount of energy, which, in turn, may represent an issue for the environment and the operational expenses of the mobile operators. The use of renewable energy to supply the small base stations has been recently considered as a mean to reduce the energy footprint of the mobile networks. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical structure in which part of the base stations are powered exclusively by solar panels and batteries. Base stations are grouped in clusters and connected in a micro-grid. A central controller enables base station sleep mode and energy sharing among the base stations based on the available energy budget and the trafﬁc demands. We propose three different implementations of the controller through Machine Learning models, namely Imitation Learning, Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning, capable of learning optimal sleep mode and energy sharing policies. We provide an exhaustive discussion on the achieved performance, complexity and feasibility of the proposed models together with the energy and cost savings attained.

        During the last decades, mobile network operators have witnessed an exponential increase in the traffic demand, mainly due to the high request of services from a huge amount of users. The trend is of a further increase in both the traffic demand and the number of connected devices over the next years. The traffic load is expected
  to have an annual growth rate of 53% for the mobile network alone, and the upcoming industrial era, which will connect different types of devices to the mobile
  infrastructure including human and machine type communications, will definitely exacerbate such an increasing trend.
  The current directions anticipate that future mobile networks will be composed of ultra dense deployments of heterogeneous Base Stations (BSs), where BSs using different transmission powers coexist. Accordingly, the traditional Macro BSs layer will be complemented or replaced with multiple overlapping tiers of small BSs (SBSs), which will allow extending the system capacity. However, the massive use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the dense deployment of network elements is going to increase the level of energy consumed by the telecommunication infrastructure and its carbon footprint on the environment.
  Current estimations indicates that 10% of the worldwide electricity generation is due to the ICT industry and this value is forecasted to reach 51% by 2030, which imply that 23% of the carbon footprint by human activity will be due to ICT. Environmental sustainability is thus a key requirement for designing next generation mobile networks.
  Recently, the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) for supplying network elements has attracted the attention of the research community, where the interest is driven by the increased efficiency and the reduced costs of energy harvesters and storage devices, specially when installed to supply SBSs. Such a solution has been demonstrated to be environmentally and economically sustainable in both rural and urban areas. However, RESs will entail a higher management complexity. In fact, environmental energy is inherently erratic and intermittent, which may cause a fluctuating energy inflow and produce service outage. A proper control of how the energy is drained and balanced across network elements is therefore necessary for a self-sustainable network design.
  In this dissertation, we focus on energy harvested through solar panels that is deemed the most appropriate due to the good efficiency of commercial photovoltaic panels as well as the wide availability of the solar source for typical installations. The characteristics of this energy source are analyzed in the first technical part of the dissertation, by considering an approach based on the extraction of features from collected data of solar energy radiation.
  In the second technical part of the thesis we introduce our proposed scenario. A federation of BSs together with the distributed harvesters and storage devices at the SBS sites form a micro-grid, whose operations are managed by an energy management system in charge of controlling the intermittent and erratic energy budget from the RESs. We consider load control (i.e., enabling sleep mode in the SBSs) as a method to properly manage energy inflow and spending, based on the traffic demand. Moreover, in the third technical part, we introduce the possibility of improving the network energy efficiency by sharing the exceeding energy that may be available at some BS sites within the micro-grid.
  Finally, centralized controller implementations based on supervised and reinforcement learning are proposed in the last technical part of the dissertation. The controller is in charge of opportunistically operating the network to achieve efficient utilization of the harvested energy and prevent SBSs blackout.

                In this paper, we focus on the design of energy self-sustainable mobile networks by enabling intelligent energy management that allows the base stations to mostly operate off-grid by using renewable energy. We propose a centralized control algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The single agent is able to learn how to efficiently balance the energy inflow and spending among base stations observing the environment and interacting with it. In particular, we provide a study on the performance achieved by this approach when considering different representations of the environment. Numerical results demonstrate that using a good level of abstraction in the choice of the representation variables may enable a proper mapping of the environment into actions to take, so as to maximize the numerical reward.

                The massive deployment of Small Base Stations (SBSs) represents one of the most promising solutions adopted by 5G cellular networks to meet the foreseen huge traffic demand. The usage of renewable energies for powering the SBSs attracted particular attention for reducing the energy footprint and, thus, mitigating the environmental impact of mobile networks and enabling cost saving for the operators. The complexity of the system and the variability of the harvesting process suggest the adoption of learning methods. Here, we investigate techniques based on the Layered Learning paradigm to control dense networks of SBSs powered solely by solar energy. In the first layer, SBSs locally select switch ON/OFF policies according to their energy income and traffic demand based on a Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning method. The second layer relies on an Artificial Neural Network that estimates the network load conditions to implement a centralized controller enforcing local agent decisions. Simulation results prove that the control of the proposed framework mimics the behavior of the upper bound obtained offline with Dynamic Programming. Moreover, the proposed layered framework outperforms both a greedy and a distributed Reinforcement Learning solution in terms of throughput and energy efficiency under different traffic conditions.

Many papers are available in the literature on this problem, however, we are approaching this issue from a different angle. In fact, we advocate for future mobile networks with a hierarchical cell structure and powered by energy harvesting hardware. Base stations within the same geographical area are grouped in a micro-grid and operate almost autonomously from the power grid. To achieve this goal, we target the design of optimal traffic and computational load control method with energy sharing within the micro-grid. We solve the optimization problem using a graph-based method and we demonstrate, via software simulations, that a combination of load control plus energy sharing represents a viable and economically convenient solution for enabling energy self-sustainability of mobile networks grouped in micro-grids.

                In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to learn hidden features of the solar energy generation from a PV system that may give a more accurate characterization of the process. In a first step, solar radiation data is converted into instantaneous solar power through a detailed source model. Then, two different approaches, namely PCA and autoencoder, are used to extract meaningful features from the traces of the solar energy generation. We interpret the latent variables characterizing the solar energy generation process by analyzing the similarities of 67 cities in Europe, North-Africa and Middle-East through an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. This analysis provides also a comparison between the feature extraction capabilities of the PCA and the autoencoder.

                  Flexible functional split in Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN) greatly overcomes fronthaul capacity and latency challenges. In such architecture, part of the baseband processing is done locally and the remaining is done remotely in the central cloud. On the other hand, Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies are increasingly adopted due to sustainability and economic advantages. Power consumption due to baseband processing has a huge share in the total power consumption breakdown of smaller base stations. Given that such base stations are powered by EH, in addition to QoS constraints, energy availability also conditions the decision on where to place each baseband function in the system. This work focuses on determining the performance bounds of an optimal placement of baseband functional split option in virtualized small cells that are solely powered by EH. The work applies Dynamic Programming (DP), in particular, Shortest Path search is used to determine the optimal functional split option considering traffic requirements and available energy budget.

To take full advantage of the harvested (renewable) energy, while still meeting the quality of service required by dense 5G deployments, suitable management techniques are here reviewed, highlighting the open issues that are still to be solved to provide eco-friendly and cost-effective mobile architectures. Several solutions have recently been proposed to tackle capacity, coverage and efficiency problems, including: C-RAN, Software Defined Networking (SDN) and fog computing, among others. However, these are not explicitly tailored to increase the energy efficiency of networks featuring renewable energy sources, and have the following limitations: (i) their energy savings are in many cases still insufficient and (ii) they do not consider network elements possessing energy harvesting capabilities. In this paper, we systematically review existing energy sustainable paradigms and methods to address points (i) and (ii), discussing how these can be exploited to obtain highly efficient, energy self-sufficient and high capacity networks. Several open issues have emerged from our review, ranging from the need for accurate energy, transmission and consumption models, to the lack of accurate data traffic profiles, to the use of power transfer, energy cooperation and energy trading techniques. These challenges are here discussed along with some research directions to follow for achieving sustainable 5G systems.

                  We propose an efficient solution to peer-to-peer localization in a wireless sensor network which works in two stages. At the first stage the optimization problem is relaxed into a convex problem, given in the form recently proposed by Soares, Xavier, and Gomes. The convex problem is efficiently solved in a distributed way by an ADMM approach, which provides a significant improvement in speed with respect to the original solution. In the second stage, a soft transition to the original, non-convex, non relaxed formulation is applied in such a way to force the solution towards a local minimum. The algorithm is built in such a way to be fully distributed, and it is tested in meaningful situations, showing its effectiveness in localization accuracy and speed of convergence, as well as its inner robustness.

                We consider real-life smart parking systems where parking lot occupancy data are collected from field sensor devices and sent to backend servers for further processing and usage for applications. Our objective is to make these data useful to end users, such as parking managers, and, ultimately, to citizens. To this end, we concoct and validate an automated classification algorithm having two objectives: (1) outlier detection: to detect sensors with anomalous behavioral patterns, i.e., outliers; and (2) clustering: to group the parking sensors exhibiting similar patterns into distinct clusters. We first analyze the statistics of real parking data, obtaining suitable simulation models for parking traces. We then consider a simple classification algorithm based on the empirical complementary distribution function of occupancy times and show its limitations. Hence, we design a more sophisticated algorithm exploiting unsupervised learning techniques (self-organizing maps). These are tuned following a supervised approach using our trace generator and are compared against other clustering schemes, namely expectation maximization, k-means clustering and DBSCAN, considering six months of data from a real sensor deployment. Our approach is found to be superior in terms of classification accuracy, while also being capable of identifying all of the outliers in the dataset.

                Il lavoro studia inizialmente l’utilizzo di Support Vector Machine per la classificazione. Vengono introdotte SVM lineari per dati separabili e non separabili e SVM non lineari con Kernel. In seguito, quanto visto in via teorica viene applicato a due casi di classificazione (Iris di Fisher e classificazione dei dati di una analisi SPECT). Per finire vengono introdotte le SVM per la regressione statistica.

                The talk focuses on the control methods for the management of mobile networks with energy harvesting capabilities. We introduce a two-tier mobile network consisting of macro base stations and renewable energy powered small base stations. Online optimization approaches based on machine learning are proposed as a way to optimize the utilization of the harvested energy by intelligently switching on/off the small base stations. Moreover, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is introduced, where the dynamic placement of functional splits is adopted as a way to further reduce the mobile network energy consumptions.

                In this talk we introduce our work in SCAVENGE, an European Training Network. The project is about sustainable design for mobile communication systems by engineering the integration and the control of renewable energy sources within communication network elements, such as base stations and mobile phones. We will describe the main objectives of the Network, detailing the training and research activities that we have been carrying out during our first year of work.

                Current trends anticipate that 5G mobile networks will be composed of ultra-dense deployments of heterogeneous Base Stations (BSs), where BSs using different transmission powers coexist to provide the 1000x network capacity increase that is required by 2020. Accordingly, the traditional macro cell layer will be complemented or replaced with multiple overlapping tiers of smaller cells, which extend the system capacity, thanks to a higher spatial reuse and to a better spectral efficiency. We introduce a two-tier cellular network architecture, where self-sustainable small cells (SCs), solely relying on energy harvesting and storage, can offload the grid-connected macro base station. The available energy at the SC must be allocated in an optimal way, in order to jointly minimize the consumption of grid energy and maximize the system performance. The proposed offline optimal algorithm, based on the label correcting algorithm, finds the optimal energy allocation policy, after transforming the problem into a shortest-path problem.
