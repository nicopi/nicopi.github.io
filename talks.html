            The fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is revolutionizing our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. However, while 5G networks offer unprecedented capabilities, there exists a crucial area that demands further enhancement: energy efficiency. Despite achieving around a 4x improvement in energy efficiency compared to 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployments, current 5G New Radio (NR) networks still consume up to 3x more energy, leading to heightened carbon emissions and increased operational costs for network operators.
            In light of the increasing interest in this field, this talk confronts the urgent challenge of 5G energy efficiency from an industrial perspective. We embark on a journey that harnesses the potential of big data and machine learning, exploring how data gleaned from thousands of base stations can be used to construct precise machine learning models to characterize the energy consumption of multi-carrier base stations. The insights gained from this framework is leveraged to create a realistic and analytically tractable power consumption model, which can drive theoretical analyses, standardization, development, and optimization frameworks. Moreover, we peer into the horizon of a future where large language models take center stage, autonomously generating explainable models, thus advancing the pursuit of energy-efficient networks.

            The talk focuses on the control methods for the management of mobile networks with energy harvesting capabilities. We introduce a two-tier mobile network consisting of macro base stations and renewable energy powered small base stations. Online optimization approaches based on machine learning are proposed as a way to optimize the utilization of the harvested energy by intelligently switching on/off the small base stations. Moreover, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is introduced, where the dynamic placement of functional splits is adopted as a way to further reduce the mobile network energy consumptions.

            Current trends anticipate that 5G mobile networks will be composed of ultra-dense deployments of heterogeneous Base Stations (BSs), where BSs using different transmission powers coexist to provide the 1000x network capacity increase that is required by 2020. Accordingly, the traditional macro cell layer will be complemented or replaced with multiple overlapping tiers of smaller cells, which extend the system capacity, thanks to a higher spatial reuse and to a better spectral efficiency. We introduce a two-tier cellular network architecture, where self-sustainable small cells (SCs), solely relying on energy harvesting and storage, can offload the grid-connected macro base station. The available energy at the SC must be allocated in an optimal way, in order to jointly minimize the consumption of grid energy and maximize the system performance. The proposed offline optimal algorithm, based on the label correcting algorithm, finds the optimal energy allocation policy, after transforming the problem into a shortest-path problem.

              The fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is revolutionizing our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. Moreover, 5G technology is allowing for the first time to expand cellular systems into new ecosystems, thus impacting every industry. Despite its unprecedented capabilities, however, 5G networks can —and must— further improve in certain key technology areas, such as that of energy efficiency. While current third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) deployments provide an improved energy efficiency of around 4x w.r.t. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) ones, they still consume up to 3x more energy. This is mostly due to the more processing required to handle the wider bandwidth and the more antennas, and is resulting in increased carbon emissions and electricity bills for operators. Even if the 3GPP NR specification provides a rich set of tools to meet IMT-2020 energy efficiency requirements, such as carrier, channel, and symbol shutdown, among others, it is important to note that one of the main energy consumption challenges of 5G networks is the complexity of their optimization in wide-area deployments: A large-scale, stochastic, non-convex and non-linear optimization problem. In light of the increasing interest in this field, this one-of-a-kind tutorial shares the author's industrial and academic views on this 5G energy efficiency problem. In more details, the tutorial provides a fresh look at energy efficiency enabling technologies in 3GPP NR, in particular, massive MIMO, carrier aggregation, the lean carrier design and different shutdown methods. By leveraging on the concepts of big data and machine learning, the tutorial presents practical scenarios in which data collected from thousands of base stations can be successfully used to derive accurate machine learning models for the main building blocks of the energy efficiency optimization problem. Furthermore, it explores the possibility of a future where generative AI plays a central role in autonomously generating explainable models, thus advancing the quest for energy-efficient networks. In this context, the tutorial delves into the adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the industry and the need for foundational telecom models and specific evaluation frameworks for generative AI.

            As the telecommunications industry continues to roll out 5G and begins to shift towards 6G technology, a significant challenge is emerging: the substantial increase in power consumption. This situation highlights the urgent need for more energy-efficient technologies. Currently, although various metrics are used to evaluate the energy efficiency of specific parts of a network, there is a clear need for a universal standard that can accurately assess the energy consumption of telecommunications systems. Although various metrics are available today to assess the energy efficiency of different network elements, the absence of a universal metric tailored for evaluating telecommunication systems is evident.
            Drawing inspiration from Harold Friis's seminal work on Noise Factor in 1944, this tutorial introduces the Waste Factor as a novel metric designed for assessing power waste in telecommunication systems. To demonstrate that the Waste Factor is a universal metric, we apply it to various scenarios. These include 5G and 6G Radio Access Networks (RANs) and Data Centers. This approach highlights the use of Waste Factor to assess the energy efficiency of both individual network components and the overall system. In these scenarios, we present a detailed comparison between prevalent energy efficiency metrics and Waste Factor, highlighting its significance for both current and future network technologies. Importantly, our tutorial includes an in-depth analysis of RAN site architectures, wherein we assess the Waste Factor of key RAN components and configurations based on real measurements. Based on this analysis, we assess the influence of multiple deployment parameters and energy-saving methods on the energy-throughput trade-off in 5G and 6G networks. Finally, we highlight that the Waste Factor is key to providing both comprehensive theoretical analysis and support system design optimization, which will pave the way for greener and more sustainable communication systems.

                The fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is changing our everyday lives, by enabling a plethora of new use cases, through its better coverage, larger capacity and massive connectivity. Thanks to its ultra-reliable low-latency communications, 5G also allows a high degree of automation, thus helping to expand cellular systems into new ecosystems. Importantly, 5G has already become an integral part of governmental and industrial environmental programs, as it is envisioned that an intelligent exploitation of their resources through 5G will significantly decrease carbon emissions. Despite its unprecedented capabilities, however, 5G networks must further improve in certain key technology areas, particularly in that of network energy efficiency. While current third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) deployments provide an improved energy efficiency of around 4x w.r.t. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) ones, they still consume up to 3x more energy, resulting in increased carbon emissions and electricity bills for operators.

In light of the increasing interest in this field, this one-of-a-kind tutorial shares the author’s industrial view on the 5G energy efficiency challenge. This tutorial provides a detailed, up-to-date overview of the most relevant technologies that a 5G radio access network can use to increase its energy efficiency from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Moreover, this tutorial shows how increasing the network energy efficiency by exploiting such technologies in practical scenarios highly depends on the accuracy of the models used to characterize the network. In this line, this tutorial exhaustively surveys and presents machine learning techniques which are being used to create accurate network models for most network components and processes, and optimize a large-scale 5G network.
